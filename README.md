# ETL Logging Native, Glue, and Redshift 


## Setup Notebook
This notebook walks through a complete, hands-on setup for a Delta Lake demo using synthetic mortgage data. It begins by clearly stating the goal: generate a self-contained dataset that can be used to illustrate key Delta Lake capabilities. It then guides you through creating a realistic mortgage dataset, which serves as the foundation for all subsequent Delta operations. Finally, it shows how to materialize that data as a clustering-ready Delta table, positioning it for later demonstrations of performance optimization and advanced Delta features such as clustering and time-travel queries.
